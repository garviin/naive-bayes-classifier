# Naive Bayes Classifier
An implementation of Supervised Naive Bayes learner created from scratch, written in Python. Investigates the effectiveness of different types of Naive Bayes across several datasets consisting of varying types and combinations of attributes.

Created for a university project. Received 90% for the project.
